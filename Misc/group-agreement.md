## Communication Plan
* A group slack channel where we can communicate when we're not physically there or after hours.
* Everyone is expected to show up and be here in-person on co-work days and lab days, if for any personal reason any team member cannot attend we will use Slack to communicate.
* Daily standups where we can bring up issues, current status, and/or new ideas.

## Conflict Plan
* If any personal issues should arise, team members are expected to go directly to a T.A. or Instructor to help resolve any issue(s).

## Work Plan
* Create a M.V.P., daily stand ups, white board any ideas, and some task tracking solution to assign tasks and technical issues.

## Git Process
* Each team member should approve each other's Pull Request.
* Once a Pull Request has been approve by all the team members, the owner of that branch should then merge the code into the repo.
